\section{Conclusion}

In conclusion, we described our visual analytics tool for understanding of classification results in Deep Neural Networks (DNNs).
Our visual components of the tool allows DNN experts to track the accuracy of their model, explore the classification results, examine the predicted score distributions of samples, and see the learned features of samples.
Eventually, our visualization helps the experts understand and diagnose the DNN model and suggest potential directions to improve the model.
This tool still has limitations in understanding inner process of DNNs and handling and visualizing a huge volume of samples.
For future work, we will investigate the ways to understand inner transactions of neurons and layers in DNNs and improve the current visual design to cover bigger size of data.
